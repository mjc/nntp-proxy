# Minimal NNTP Proxy Configuration
# This is the simplest possible configuration - just one backend server
# Client authentication is optional and not required

host = "news.example.com"
port = 119
name = "News Server"

# That's it! The proxy will run with defaults:
# - No client authentication
# - Max 10 connections per backend
# - Health checks every 30 seconds
# - No TLS
# - Hybrid routing mode (automatic per-command to stateful switching)
