# TLS/SSL Configuration Guide:
# - use_tls: Enable TLS/SSL encryption for this server (default: false)
# - tls_verify_cert: Verify server certificates using system certificate store (default: true, STRONGLY recommended)
# - tls_cert_path: Optional path to additional CA certificate file (PEM format)
#                  Note: This ADDS to system certs, does not replace them
#
# System Certificate Stores by OS:
# - Linux: Uses system CA bundle (usually /etc/ssl/certs)
# - macOS: Uses Security.framework (Keychain)
# - Windows: Uses SChannel (Windows Certificate Store)
#
# Only disable tls_verify_cert for testing/development - it's a security risk!
#
# Note: max_connections defaults to 10 if not specified
# Each server can have different limits based on your provider's restrictions
# Common NNTP ports: 119 (plain), 563 (NNTPS/SSL), 8119 (custom)
